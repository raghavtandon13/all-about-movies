# All About Movies
## Introduction
This is a movie recommendation program designed to suggest movies based on user preferences. The program uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to analyze user behavior and suggest movies based on their similarity to movies that the user has previously watched and enjoyed.
The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews
